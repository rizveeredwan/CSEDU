# CSEDU Online Research Repository

## Project Idea In Short:
We want to make an web based application to make our thesis projects more organized. What problems we actually faced doing research this year, is if you want to know about your seniors works you need to go to library and find their thesis books. But among so many books this is little bit tiresome. If there was some on line repository it would have been much easier to know about them.

So we want to make an web based application system to manage the whole system much easier. It will also provide a way to communicate among different research groups.

## Features of the Project:
- Authentication System - So that only defined person can view/download/upload files.
- Search Facility to get desired thesis book/presentation
- Email Facility to communicate
- Collaborative and Personal , both type of facilities for each research group

It is a web based application which builds a platform to keep all the research works online for an institute to create a collaborative and extendable research environment. It was created as an academic project for the course web engineering and application under supervision of Dr.Mamun-or-Rashid and Mahmudur Rahman Rana at Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Dhaka.

## Technical Aspects
- Front End Lanugage: HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript
